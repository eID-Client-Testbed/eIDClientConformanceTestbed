	<Title>Test case EID_CLIENT_D_10</Title>
	<Version>1.2</Version>
	<Purpose>This test case verifies the eID-Client to advise the user about the current value of the retry counter of the PIN if the PIN verification fails.</Purpose>
	<Profile>UI_OFFLINE</Profile>
	<Reference>TR-03124-1, Chapter 3 "Functional Requirements for an eID-Client"</Reference>
	<Precondition>The card reader in use has neither display, nor PIN-Pad.</Precondition>
	<Precondition>The eID-Client offers its services.</Precondition>
	<Precondition>Active eID-Card with the PIN already set.</Precondition>
	<Precondition>The current PIN of the eID-Card is known.</Precondition>
	<Precondition>The PIN retry counter of the eID-Card is 3.</Precondition>
	<TestStep>
		<Command>
			<Text>Start the procedure of changing the PIN. When requested, enter [PIN_NOK] and [PIN_TMP] as the new PIN.</Text>
		</Command>
		<Description>[PIN_NOK] is a wrong PIN for the eID-Card.</Description>
