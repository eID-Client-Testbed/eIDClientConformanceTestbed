ecard.testcase.description=This test case checks whether the user is requested to enter his PUK on the secure PIN entry if the card reader provides one.\nStart the procedure of changing the PIN using the current PIN manually to evaluate the requirements. When requested, enter [PIN_NOK] and [PIN_TMP] as the new PIN. \nFollowing behavior is expected:\n - The eID-Client forces the user to use secure PIN entry.\n - eID-Client returns an error message regarding the [PIN_NOK] being wrong.\n - The eID-Client informs the user about the current value of the retry counter of the PIN, which is 2.\nRepeat the previous step.\nFollowing behavior is expected:\n - eID-Client returns an error message regarding the [PIN_NOK] being wrong.\n - The eID-Client informs the user about the current value of the retry counter of the PIN, which is 1.\nRepeat the previous step.\nFollowing behavior is expected:\n - The eID-Client informs that the current retry counter of the PIN is 1, therefore it is suspended and must be resumed.\nStart the procedure of resuming a suspended PIN using the CAN. When requested, enter [CAN].\nFollowing behavior is expected:\n - The eID-Client indicates the successful verification of the [CAN]. No error returned.\nStart the procedure of changing the PIN using the current PIN. When requested, enter [PIN_NOK] and [PIN_TMP] as the new PIN.\nFollowing behavior is expected:\n - The eID-Client forces the user to use secure PIN entry.\n - The eID-Client returns an error message regarding the [PIN_NOK] being wrong.\n - eID-Client returns an error message regarding the PIN being blocked.\nStart the procedure of unblocking of a blocked PIN using the PUK. When requested, enter the [PUK].\nFollowing behavior is expected:\n - The eID-Client forces the user to use secure PIN entry.\n - [PUK] is successfully verified and accepted by the eID-Client. No error returned.\nIn order to verify the result, repeat the procedure of changing the PIN using the current PIN. Use [PIN] as current PIN and [PIN] as the new PIN.\nFollowing behavior is expected:\n - The eID-Client forces the user to use secure PIN entry.\n - [PIN] is successfully verified and accepted by the eID-Client. No error returned.\nAfterwards the result has to be set manually  of the test case.
